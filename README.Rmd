This repo contains an R library and an R Shiny app. Both of which can be used to look at Premier League game stats.

### Data

The match data is sourced from [football-data.co.uk](http://www.football-data.co.uk).


## R Library

The library can be install in R using the [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) library.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aboland/footballR")
```


## Shiny App
 
The Shiny app takes the match data and visually displays statistics. The application is hosted at [pl.aboland.ie](http://pl.aboland.ie/).

Alternatively the app can be run locally using the above R library.
```r
footballR::run_ShinyApp()
```
