# Fantasy football shiny app
 
Takes data from premier league website and gives up to date standings for the league. The application is hosted on [ff.aboland.ie](http://ff.aboland.ie/).


The league tables are pulled directly from [fantasy football site](http://fantasy.premierleague.com), the player data is too large to do this on the fly. The data files store the information about the players, this need to be updated periodically.
**player data is currently out of date**
