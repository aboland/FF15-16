# Fantasy football shiny app
 
Takes data from premier league website and gives up to date standings for the league. Scrape script is run on my local machine and updates the data. The application is hosted on shinyapps at the moment, see web address above.

Testing branch seems to be working but I have to manually push.... `$git push origin testing`

The league tables are pulled directly from [fantasy football site](fantasy.premierleague.com), the player data is too large to do this on the fly. The data files store the information about the players, this need to be updated periodically.
