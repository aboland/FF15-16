# Premier League Shiny App
 
Takes premier league match data and visually displays statistics. The application is hosted on [ff.aboland.ie](http://ff.aboland.ie/). The match data is taken from [football-data.co.uk](http://www.football-data.co.uk).


The player data is pulled directly from the premier leagues [http://fantasy football site](http://fantasy.premierleague.com), the player data is too large to do this on the fly. The data files store the information about the players, this need to be updated periodically.
**player data is currently out of date**
